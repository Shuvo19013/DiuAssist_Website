        <h4>Registration</h4>
        <p>In every semester, date for registration will be notified. The students must be registered within the specified date. 
        All fees are to be paid at the time of registration and are non-refundable except (i) 
        where the University fails to provide a place to the students in a course and (ii) courses dropped 
        by the student in the first week of registration. The student will in such cases get a refund of the tuition fee and other 
        charges except registration/ admission fee.</p>
        <h4>Registration Procedure</h4>
        <p>A student seeking registration for the semester should:<br><br>
            1. Pay registration fees to the accounts office within schedule date and collect a software generated registration clearance if all dues are cleared.<br>
            2. Collect the course offer paper from the corresponding department.<br>
            3. Students have to contact with their course advisor according to the course advising date with that clearance and select courses in consultation with the student’s advisor.<br>
            4. After successful completion of registration a print copy of confirmation letter will be provided.</p>
        <h4>Transfer from other University</h4>
        <p>Students with good academic records from other recognized University are eligible for transfer of their credits to DIU. Students wiling to transfer from another university must have transcripts of courses and grades, together with the copies of certificate/ mark sheet of SSC or HSC or transcripts of O and A levels. These Transcripts will be evaluated against the minimum entry requirement at DIU.</p>
        <h4>Admission of International Students</h4>
        <p>nternational students meeting equivalent admission qualification are eligible for admission as regular students or as special students for a part of the duration and may acquire transfer credits. In case of the latter, the recommended minimum duration of residence in the first and the second years is one semester. The University may enroll foreign students under an exchange program established between two universities.<br><br>
          Admission is also open to any person who wishes to pursue courses or a course as a non-degree student to improve knowledge or acquire new skills. Students are also admitted for specific certificate or diploma courses.</p>
        <h4>Student Dismissal</h4>
        <p>Students are dismissed from the program for failure to make satisfactory academic progress. Students failing to maintain the required CGPA (2.0) in two consecutive semesters will be dropped out of the program. Students dropped out of the program may appeal to the Dean/ Head of the Department/ Coordinator for re-admission. Re-admission will not be granted without strong evidence of significant change in student’s ability to complete the requirements satisfactorily.</p>
        <h4>Retake Policy</h4>
        <p>A course passed with a grade less than B may be repeated to improve the relevant grade. When a course is repeated, the previous grade will be automatically cancelled. Students, failing in a course, will be allowed to repeat that course twice at the most on payment of course fee</p>
